 ![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Discription
The purpose of this project is to successfully develop an API that can be used by a social network web application. This project is specifically focused on creating a basic backend using a MongoDB database, Express.js for connectivity, and Mongoose as a bridge between Node.js and MongoDB. With this application, a user will be able to share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. In short, its an exercise that holds a useful purpose for further development in creating ones own full-stack social media application.

## Installation Processes
There are no steps to install this project. Please refer to the section on how to run this application successfully by first establishing a connection in the terminal and then testing the application's route via Insomnia.

## App Usage
First, with this project downloaded locally and running on your text editor of choice, open the terminal inside the root folder. Once open, type "npm run start" to establish a connection with the server. Inside the terminal you should see a message that says "API server running on port 3001!". This is confirmation that the connection is extablished. Next, open Insomnia and create three folders, one for User, Thoughts, and Reactions. Inside each folder, create files to perfom the CRUD medthod, allowing us to test our functionality. For example: "Create User", "Get all Users", "Get User by ID", "Update User", " and "Delete User". Watch the video below to see examples of folder/file structure, and how to perform route testing:
